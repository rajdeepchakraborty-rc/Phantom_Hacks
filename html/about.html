                    Halloween is an annual holiday celebrated each year on October 31, and Halloween 2018 occurs on
                    Wednesday, October 31. It originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when people would
                    light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the eighth century, Pope Gregory III
                    designated November 1 as a time to honor all saints; soon, All Saints Day incorporated some of the
                    traditions of Samhain. The evening before was known as All Hallows Eve, and later Halloween. Over
                    time, Halloween evolved into a day of activities like trick-or-treating, carving jack-o-lanterns,
                    festive gatherings, donning costumes and eating sweet treats.
                </p>
                <h2>Ancient Origins of Halloween</h2>
                <p>Halloweenâ€™s origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced sow-in). The
                    Celts, who lived 2,000 years ago in the area that is now Ireland, the United Kingdom and northern
                    France, celebrated their new year on November 1.

                    This day marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter, a time
                    of year that was often associated with human death. Celts believed that on the night before the new
                    year, the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead became blurred. On the night of
                    October 31 they celebrated Samhain, when it was believed that the ghosts of the dead returned to
                    earth.

                        align="left">
                    In addition to causing trouble and damaging crops, Celts thought that the presence of the
                    otherworldly spirits made it easier for the Druids, or Celtic priests, to make predictions about the
                    future. For a people entirely dependent on the volatile natural world, these prophecies were an
                    important source of comfort and direction during the long, dark winter.

                    To commemorate the event, Druids built huge sacred bonfires, where the people gathered to burn crops
                    and animals as sacrifices to the Celtic deities. During the celebration, the Celts wore costumes,
                    typically consisting of animal heads and skins, and attempted to tell each otherâ€™s fortunes.

                    When the celebration was over, they re-lit their hearth fires, which they had extinguished earlier
                    that evening, from the sacred bonfire to help protect them during the coming winter.

                <h2>Halloween Parties</h2>
                <p>
                    By the 1920s and 1930s, Halloween had become a secular, but community-centered holiday, with parades
                    and town-wide Halloween parties as the featured entertainment. Despite the best efforts of many
                    schools and communities, vandalism began to plague some celebrations in many communities during this
                    time.
                    By the 1950s, town leaders had successfully limited vandalism and Halloween had evolved into a
                    holiday directed mainly at the young. Due to the high numbers of young children during the fifties
                    baby boom, parties moved from town civic centers into the classroom or home, where they could be
                    more easily accommodated.
                    Between 1920 and 1950, the centuries-old practice of trick-or-treating was also revived.
                    Trick-or-treating was a relatively inexpensive way for an entire community to share the Halloween
                    celebration. In theory, families could also prevent tricks being played on them by providing the
                    neighborhood children with small treats.
                    Thus, a new American tradition was born, and it has continued to grow. Today, Americans spend an
                    estimated $6 billion annually on Halloween, making it the countryâ€™s second largest commercial
                    holiday after Christmas.
