                <p>
                    The classic Halloween event of carving pumpkins and displaying them on porches is a great way to
                    spend time with family and friends. Pumpkins become available for purchase early in October along
                    with many types of "pumpkin carving kits" that include various tools and patterns. For very young
                    children that shouldn't handle knives, they may decorate the outside of a pumpkin using paint,
                    stickers, or anything suitable one may find at a craft store.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you were to ask a child what he or she enjoys most about Halloween, they would probably
                    say one thing: Candy!
                    Trick-or-treating is a defining event of Halloween, and the one many children look forward
                    to the most.
                    In most places, trick-or-treating begins in the evening, around 6 p.m. on the day of
                    Halloween, October 31st.
                    Households who hand out the candy may either simply leave the candy out on the porch for
                    children to take or answer the door to each child and hand them a piece of candy themselves.

                <p>
                    Bobbing for apples is an iconic Halloween game that can be great fun for kids and adults
                    alike.
                    Simply fill a tub or large basin with water and throw an ample amount of apples in.
                    The rules are simple: Without using your hands or arms, try to pick up an apple with only
                    your mouth!
